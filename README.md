# Brain Tumors Classification Model

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. To reduce these deaths, technology needs to be used to help in early cancer detection and proper diagnosis.

Deep learning using models such as CNN can be beneficial in cancer and tumors detections through image classification.

This projects explores the use of different CNN models such as VGG19 and EfficientNet in brain tumors classification using MRI scans data.
